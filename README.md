# A Vue + Vite + Tailwindcss Project

First make sure you install Node.js to your local machine.
Links for the installation are [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

**Note I cannot gurantee a smooth installtion with Windows OS even with WSL**

then just clone this project and open your terminal:

```
cd "/Project Location"
npm install
```
then to start your own live server with vite.

```
npm run dev
```

the database is on my other project for back-end
